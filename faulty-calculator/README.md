# FAULTY CALCULATOR

## This calculator is devised using JavaScript only. 

## It does the following: 
### 1. It takes two numbers as input from the user. 
### 2. It performs wrong operations 10% of the times, as follows: 
#### a. If the user wants to Add them it will Subtract the numbers. 
#### b. If the user wants to Multiply them it will Add the numbers.
#### c. If the user wants to Subtract them it will Divide the numbers.
#### d. If the user wants to Divide them it will perform Exponential operations on the numbers.

## Unlike the programs in basics folder, I have used "readline-sync" to take user-input.
